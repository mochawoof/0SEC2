# About
Welcome to the 0SEC2 repo! Here you can take a look at the source code, make changes and install new versions.

## Installation
- Make sure you have Java installed! 0SEC2 works best with Java 8.
- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/mochawoof/0sec2/releases/latest/download/0sec2.zip) and extract it.
- Just double-click 0SEC2.bat to run!

## Adding Apps
- To add an app, just drag n drop the app folder into 0SEC2.
- It's easiest to download apps from [my Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W_7SJnmdbcSrTfQdzSx4X4TKpFhLfR66?usp=sharing), where they're optimized and tested.
- If not, 0SEC2 will try its best to add it! If it's not working try to make sure the app .exe is in the top level of the folder, and its name doesn't have any spaces in it.

## Contributing
- I recommend using BlueJ 4.11 for contributing, but any other IDE that supports Java 8 is fine too.
- Make sure to add the 2 .jar libraries to the classpath when building!
- Everything in the out folder will be added to releases.
- When uploading your changes, first make sure to change the version number (change the 3rd number for a patch, or the 2nd for a bigger addition) and run clean.bat.
